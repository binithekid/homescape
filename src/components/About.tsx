        <p className="text-sm text-gray-500">
          Founded in 2021 by Alex London, InsightEdge was born out of a unique
          blend of expertise in private equity, investor relations, and digital
          marketing. With over 12 years of experience working alongside
          investors and fund managers, Alex developed a deep understanding of
          deal life cycles and the critical role marketing plays in driving
          EBITDA and other key financial performance metrics.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm text-gray-500">
          Throughout his career, Alex built and nurtured valuable relationships,
          connecting fund managers with investors while gaining insight into the
          pain points surrounding marketing due diligence. He recognized a
          significant gap in how marketing levers were influencing financial
          outcomes but often lacked the in-depth analysis to support value
          creation.
        </p>
        <p className="text-sm text-gray-500">
          Fueled by a passion for finance and digital strategy, Alex leveraged
          his knowledge to create InsightEdgeâ€”a consulting firm that bridges the
          gap between marketing performance and financial success, offering
          private equity firms and portfolio companies a powerful new approach
          to unlocking growth and maximising returns.
